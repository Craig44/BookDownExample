[["index.html", "An Example book down Chapter 1 About 1.1 Process to publish bookdown on GH page", " An Example book down C.Marsh 2022-05-07 Chapter 1 About This is a sample book written in Markdown. The purpose was to learn how to host a bookdown on a github pages site for future projects of mine. Any repo can have a bookdown directory which can then be used by Github actions to host it on a gihub page. For example, the bookdown location that created this page is in the sub-directory called Documentation at https://github.com/Craig44/BookDownExample. 1.1 Process to publish bookdown on GH page Create a folder in your github repository that contains your bookdown. A good way to get started is to download the GitHub repository https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo as a Zip file, then unzip it locally. This is a minimal bookdown that is very helpful to get started. Once you have a bookdown that compiles locally commit and push the necessary files to the remote repository and create a github actions workflow. I use the following yaml script can be found here. Which we will work through soon. Before we do that, the next thing you will need to do is setup a github.io for your username or organisation see here for more information. The next thing you will need is to create an empty branch on your github repository to deploy the bookdown. I used the git command line calls below which was taken from here cd /path/to/repo-name git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/gh-pages rm .git/index git clean -fdx echo &quot;My GitHub Page&quot; &gt; index.html git add . git commit -a -m &quot;First pages commit&quot; git push origin gh-pages To test you have set up the github.io and gh-pages branch correctly, you should be able to visit USERNAME.github.io/REPONAME or if it is with an organization ORGANISATION.github.io/REPONAME and see a website that has My GitHub Page displayed from the above gh-page branch. A tip if you can’t see the webpage, go to the settings tab in your repository and go to the pages tab. This will tell you where/if your webpage is being hosted. Settings tab Once you have a github.io and gh-pages branch the next thing is to set up a github actions workflow. I will work through the following calls and explain the key points. The first section renders the gitbook into html files and saves it as an artifact called _book. jobs: bookdown: name: Render-Book runs-on: macOS-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v1 - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1 - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-pandoc@v1 - name: Install rmarkdown run: Rscript -e &#39;install.packages(c(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;,&quot;bookdown&quot;))&#39; - name: Render Book run: Rscript -e &#39;bookdown::render_book(input = &quot;Documentation&quot;)&#39; - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v1 with: name: _book path: Documentation/_book/ The key parameters in this are bookdown::render_book(input = \"Documentation\") where if your bookdown is in a subdirectory you need to provid that directory by the input parameter. In addition to the artifact path on the last line path: Documentation/_book/. See how they are both Documentation, that is because this is the directory of my bookdown but this could be any directory that you store your bookdown in. The next section of the workflow takes the artifact called _book publishes it to the branch called gh-pages where it can be visualised at your github.io site. # gh-action from Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy checkout-and-deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest needs: bookdown steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Download artifact uses: actions/download-artifact@v1.0.0 with: # Artifact name name: _book # optional # Destination path path: _book # optional - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages uses: Cecilapp/GitHub-Pages-deploy@v3 env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # https://github.com/settings/tokens with: email: Craig.Marsh@niwa.co.nz # must be a verified email build_dir: _book/ # &quot;_site/&quot; by default branch: gh-pages # hosted the parameters and inputs for this github action may change over time, to see the latest options and version see here. The key component of this process is making sure your repository allows read and write access for the workflow. To see and change these go to settings tab (see figure above) of your github repository followed by the Actions tab scroll down to the Workflow permissions section where you want to make sure it is set to read and write. Once you push that workflow fingers crossed it will render and publish. "],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 2 Hello bookdown 2.1 A section", " Chapter 2 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
