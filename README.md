# BookDownExample
This repo is an example repo of how you can add a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/home/) to any github repository and host it on a [github.io page](https://pages.github.com/).

The directory **Documentation** contains my bookdown which is hosted at [https://craig44.github.io/BookDownExample/](https://craig44.github.io/BookDownExample/). The bookdown 
discusses the key processes that I went through to publish the bookdown.

The idea is once I get my act together... I will document some of my future and existing repositories a lot better which will help me, in addition to others understand and reproduce my work.
